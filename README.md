# 🌍 IoT Environmental Monitoring System

This project uses an Arduino UNO R4 WiFi, DHT11, and MQ135 sensor to monitor temperature, humidity, and air quality, and uploads the data to ThingSpeak for real-time visualization.

## 📦 Components Used
- Arduino UNO R4 WiFi
- DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- MQ135 Air Quality Sensor
- Breadboard + Jumper Wires
- ThingSpeak (for cloud data storage and visualization)

## 🛠️ Features
- Reads temperature, humidity, and air quality every 15 seconds
- Sends data to ThingSpeak
- View real-time graphs on a web dashboard
