#  IoT Environmental Monitoring System

This is a personal IoT project that monitors **temperature**, **humidity**, and **air quality** in real-time using an **Arduino UNO R4 WiFi**, a **DHT11 sensor**, and an **MQ135 air quality sensor**.
The data is uploaded every 20 seconds to the cloud using **ThingSpeak**, where it is visualized with live charts.

>  Built as a personal project to apply embedded systems, cloud communication, and sensor data processing â€” ideal for smart climate education initiatives and IoT learning.

##  Components Used
- Arduino UNO R4 WiFi
- DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- MQ135 Air Quality Sensor
- Breadboard + Jumper Wires
- ThingSpeak (for cloud data storage and visualization)

##  Features
- Reads temperature, humidity, and air quality every 15 seconds
- Wireless data upload to ThingSpeak using built-in WiFi
- View real-time graphs on a web dashboard
- Dynamic data visualization 
- Auto-refreshing dashboard with historical tracking
